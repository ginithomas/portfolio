## PURPOSE:
The purpose is to provide a personal portfolio showcasing myself and learned programming abilities through website creation, resume, blogs and other components as to gain the audience of prospective employers and other IT professionals.

## FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES:
* **Navigation Bar**: Created using links easily visible to the audience as they are centered within the viewer's immediate eyeline when opening the website. The will allow acess to other pages within the website. 

* **Socials Links**: Along the right-hand side of each web page are the social links, providing the audience with an easily accessible click into professional social media accounts of mine for further viewings of my IT career and learnings.


* **Home Page**: As an intital viewpoint to my portfolio, I have added a typewriter effect giving a very brief intoduction of myself. This is then place upon a shadowbox.

* **Blogs**: The blog/blog posts section of my website allows the audience to view article that I have created. The blog page breaks into article headings containing clickable links to each blog post. 

* **Contact**: The contact section contains a working contact form to provide those interested in reaching out an easy form of contact, however, they may also contact me directly as I have listed business details on the side of the form. I have also added a "hand-emoji" in place of the usual submit button to engage the sender to "high-five" to submit their forms. 

* **Resume**: As I am wishing to attract potential employers to view my portfolio, I have added a download button to easily gain a pdf copy of my resume. This is found within the 'Portfolio' section of the navigation bar.
